# C++ Learning Codes ðŸš€

This repository contains all the basic C++ programs I wrote while learning the language.  
I started from scratch and added codes as I progressed through topics like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, etc.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Variables & Data Types
- If-Else Statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Pointers (later)
- Basic OOP (coming soon...)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
01-Basics
02-Conditionals
03-loops
